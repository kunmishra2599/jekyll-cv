# Profile
profile: |
  Hi, I'm Kunal! I'm a third year Computational Biology Ph.D. student under the joint supervision of Assoc. Prof. Jacques Behmoaras and Assoc. Prof Enrico Petretto. I have experience working in both genomics and transcriptomics. In the past, I've worked in the wet lab performing cell culture and molecular biology experiments. 
  <br> <br> My research mainly focuses on unravelling the complex role of macrophages in the context of chronic kidney disease through cross-species integrative analyses and systems genetics approaches. In our lab, we use both genetic and experimental animal models, combined with human samples to study kidney diseases.
